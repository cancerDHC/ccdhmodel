# Data examples demonstrating several proposed approaches for representing coded/enumerated values in the CRDC-H as well as the ObservationSet/Observation patterns
# The source GDC data describes AJCC cancer staging for a patient.  The GDC model defines separate fields for each staging system (e.g. AJCC, FIGO, etc.) and staging system component (e.g. clinical m, pathologic t, etc.)

# This case can be found on the GDC Portal at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/cases/3cdbf331-991d-41cb-a694-a2aa95c4aa26

# Each proposed approach should illustrate how the CRDC-H might represent the harmonized/canonical staging value(s), as well as where/how the original source values get represented (which may be in the data/message, or in an external mapping file).
