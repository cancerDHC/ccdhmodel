          often relates to the clinical behavior of the particular tumor. Based on
          the microscopic findings, tumor grade is commonly described by one of four
          degrees of severity. Histopathologic grade of a tumor may be used to plan
          treatment and estimate the future course, outcome, and overall prognosis
          of disease. Certain types of cancers, such as soft tissue sarcoma, primary
          brain tumors, lymphomas, and breast have special grading systems.

    - At the core of an Observation is a flexible key-value pair (or a structured
      collection of key-value pairs), where a 'key' field defines the type of observation
      made, and the 'value' field describes the value or outcome of the observation.
      The fact that the type of observation captured is defined in the data allow
      Observation to convey a broad range of observation data.

          likely have a different "id" in the new system since "id" values are system

    - An Observation Set is comprised of one or more logically related Observations
      made about the same entity. The Observations in a set may be grouped because
      they were generated on a single occasion using a common methodology (e.g. a
      blood panel), and/or or because describe aspects of the same underlying feature
      of an entity and as such are considered together as a logical unit of information
      (e.g. diastolic and systolic measures that comprise a blood pressure observation,
      or T, N, and M components of a Cancer Staging observation).

        name: id
        description: The 'logical' identifier of the entity within the system of record.  The
          simple value of this attribute stands for an identifier of this data object
          within the system, it can be used as a reference from other objects within
          the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys), and it should be unique
          per type of object. The same data object copied to a different system will
          likely have a different "id" in the new system since "id" values are system
          specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business
          identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured
          in the "identifier" field. The "id" field is more likely to be a serially
          or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is
          created in a system.

          entity may have a different ''id'' in a different system, and have many
          external business ''identifiers'' associated with it. If an "id" value can
          also be considered to be a business identifier, and should be transmissible
          to other systems, it should be duplicated in the "identifier" attribute
          along with the additional metadata needed to give context to the value of
          "id". An entity in this model that does not have an "id" field is considered
          to be an embeddable entity that can not stand on its own. '

    comments:
    - At the core of an Observation is a flexible key-value pair (or a structured
      collection of key-value pairs), where a 'key' field defines the type of observation
      made, and the 'value' field describes the value or outcome of the observation.
      The fact that the type of observation captured is defined in the data allow
      Observation to convey a broad range of observation data.

    - An Observation Set is comprised of one or more logically related Observations
      made about the same entity. The Observations in a set may be grouped because
      they were generated on a single occasion using a common methodology (e.g. a
      blood panel), and/or or because describe aspects of the same underlying feature
      of an entity and as such are considered together as a logical unit of information
      (e.g. diastolic and systolic measures that comprise a blood pressure observation,
      or T, N, and M components of a Cancer Staging observation).

          the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys), and it should be unique
          per type of object. The same data object copied to a different system will
          likely have a different "id" in the new system since "id" values are system
          specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business
          identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured
          in the "identifier" field. The "id" field is more likely to be a serially
          or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is
          created in a system.

    comments:
    - QuantityMeasure' may be implemented as an Observation-like object that will
      let us capture any type of measure of the amount of some substance (e.g. weight,
      volume, maybe even concentration?), with distinct timestamps and methods associated.  It
      could be implemented as a "simple" observation (one measurement per instance,
      where the 'code' fields is bound to a value set describing the different types
      of quantity measures allowed -  e.g. 'weight', 'volume', 'concentration'),  or
      as "composite" observation (multiple measurements possible in a single instance,
      each captured as a component defined to hold a specific type of quantity measure
      - e.g.  'weight', 'volume', 'concentration').  The number of different quantity
      measures we anticipate needed to support, and the potential for data sparseness,
      are factors that determine whether a simple or composite Observation would be
      most appropriate.

        description: The 'logical' identifier of the entity within the system of record.  The
          simple value of this attribute stands for an identifier of this data object
          within the system, it can be used as a reference from other objects within
          the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys), and it should be unique
          per type of object. The same data object copied to a different system will
          likely have a different "id" in the new system since "id" values are system
          specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business
          identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured
          in the "identifier" field. The "id" field is more likely to be a serially
          or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is
          created in a system.

        - 'FHIR naming conventions are followed here, where ''id'' is used for logical
          identifiers, and ''identifier'' for business identifiers.   The identified
          entity may have a different ''id'' in a different system, and have many
          external business ''identifiers'' associated with it. If an "id" value can
          also be considered to be a business identifier, and should be transmissible
          to other systems, it should be duplicated in the "identifier" attribute
          along with the additional metadata needed to give context to the value of
          "id". An entity in this model that does not have an "id" field is considered
          to be an embeddable entity that can not stand on its own. '

          and persist across implementing systems. Also, since these identifiers are
          created outside the information system through a specific business process,
          the Identifier type has additional attributes to capture this additional
          metadata so the actual identifier values are qualified by the context that
          created those values. This additional context allows "identifier" instances
          to be transmitted as business data across systems while still being able
          to trace them back to the system of origin.

        - FHIR naming conventions are followed here, where 'id' is used for logical
          identifiers which are unique only within a given system, and 'identifier'
          for business identifiers, which are used to connect entities or share content
          across systems.  The complex 'Identifier' data type is used  to capture
          the identifier itself, along with metadata about its source.

        - Our model defines a single 'Specimen' type to cover speific subtypes of
          specimens delineated in some CRDC node models (e.g. GDC 'Sample', 'Portion',
          'Aliquot', 'Analyte', and 'Slide'). The 'specimen_type' field is used to
          indicate which subtype a given Specimen instance represents.  The enumerated
          values are meant to be mutually exclusive, such that only one can be applied
          to a given specimen.

          likely have a different "id" in the new system since "id" values are system
          specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business
          identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured
          in the "identifier" field. The "id" field is more likely to be a serially

          created in a system.

          the Identifier type has additional attributes to capture this additional

          created those values. This additional context allows "identifier" instances
          to be transmitted as business data across systems while still being able
          to trace them back to the system of origin.

        - At present our model collapses two types of processes through which specimens
          are created (initial collection from source, and derivation from an existing
          specimen).  The 'category' is a flag to indicate which applies to a given
          instance, so that more specific recommendations about data entry in certain
          fields can be specified.

    - At the core of an Observation is a flexible key-value pair (or a structured
      collection of key-value pairs), where a 'key' field defines the type of observation
      made, and the 'value' field describes the value or outcome of the observation.
      The fact that the type of observation captured is defined in the data allow
      Observation to convey a broad range of observation data.

        - 'The ''focus'', ''subject'', and ''specimen'' fields are useful when data
          creators want an Observation object to stand on its own, so it can point
          back to the entities it is about.  These fields are not needed when an Observation
          is embedded in a Specimen or other entity, where focus, subject, and specimen
          can be determined from context. '

          and persist across implementing systems. Also, since these identifiers are
          created outside the information system through a specific business process,
          the Identifier type has additional attributes to capture this additional
          metadata so the actual identifier values are qualified by the context that
          created those values. This additional context allows "identifier" instances
          to be transmitted as business data across systems while still being able
          to trace them back to the system of origin.

        comments:
        - FHIR naming conventions are followed here, where 'id' is used for logical
          identifiers which are unique only within a given system, and 'identifier'
          for business identifiers, which are used to connect entities or share content
          across systems.  The complex 'Identifier' data type is used  to capture
          the identifier itself, along with metadata about its source.

    - This entity is overloaded with the idea of medication/substance based treatments,
      and other more procedure-like interventions that are also considered to be a
      treatment. We should probably separate these concerns and it will be useful
      to have a "Procedure" entity long term. If that is done, this entity will be
      renamed to "MedicationTreatment" or something like that and the other concerns
      refactored out to other entities. Also, if we can consider a medication/substance
      based treatment as a procedure as well (which is commonly the case in other
      models), we can make this entity more about the individual doses for such treatments
      if that level of granularity is needed.

          the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys), and it should be unique
          per type of object. The same data object copied to a different system will
          likely have a different "id" in the new system since "id" values are system
          specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business
          identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured
          in the "identifier" field. The "id" field is more likely to be a serially
          or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is
          created in a system.

          the Identifier type has additional attributes to capture this additional
          metadata so the actual identifier values are qualified by the context that
          created those values. This additional context allows "identifier" instances
          to be transmitted as business data across systems while still being able
          to trace them back to the system of origin.
