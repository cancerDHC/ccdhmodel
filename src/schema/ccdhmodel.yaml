    - 'MHB: Not sure about how I modeled this one.  Also, consider collapsing with
      ''eliqibility_flag'' , and any other status/role related elements, into a single
      property with a  generic data type that can capture any type of status or role.


      BTF: as with ''status'' above, there is a similar attribute in ADM.Case which
      i left named ''is_reference'' for lack of imagination.


      SE: same thought as above but probably too much change to consider for this
      cycle. This field and similar ones are really not an attribute of a single entity.
      It''s a "relational fact" that involves multiple entity instances and the fact
      itself holds some attributes. Saying this in plain English makes this clear.
      For example, this can be worded as "Study x uses specimen y and uses specimen
      z as a reference". So one option is to figure out how to reduce this to a simple
      property and this is doable if we put more meaning on the instance of x and
      y. If we say that we''ll have an instance of y for every study the real thing
      behind y (the real world specimen), i.e. y stands for the role of the real specimen
      in the specific study, then we can have a simle property on that instance to
      say it is a reference because that property is specific to y''s role in that
      study, not the real y entity in the world. We haven''t talked much about the
      meaning of the instances of our entities, i.e. when should they be instantiated
      and what does the instance stand for in the data, so it''s hard to decide on
      how to model attriburtes. Just thinking out loud here but some of our difficulties
      are due to not also thinking at the instance level.'
