        name: id
        description: The 'logical' identifier of the entity within the system of record.  The
          simple value of this attribute stands for an identifier of this data object
          within the system, it can be used as a reference from other objects within
          the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys), and it should be unique
          per type of object. The same data object copied to a different system will
          likely have a different "id" in the new system since "id" values are system
          specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business
          identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured
          in the "identifier" field. The "id" field is more likely to be a serially
          or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is
          created in a system.
        notes:

        comments:
        - 'FHIR naming conventions are followed here, where ''id'' is used for logical
          identifiers, and ''identifier'' for business identifiers.   The identified
          entity may have a different ''id'' in a different system, and have many
          external business ''identifiers'' associated with it. If an "id" value can
          also be considered to be a business identifier, and should be transmissible
          to other systems, it should be duplicated in the "identifier" attribute
          along with the additional metadata needed to give context to the value of

    - 'More than one code may be used in CodeableConcept. The concept may be coded
      multiple times in different code systems (or even multiple times in the same
      code systems, where multiple forms are possible). Each Coding is a representation
      of the concept as described above and may have slightly different granularity
      due to the differences in the definitions of the underlying codes. There is
      no meaning associated with the ordering of Coding within a CodeableConcept.
      A typical use of CodeableConcept is to send the local code that the concept
      was coded with, and also one or more translations to publicly defined code systems
      such as LOINC or SNOMED CT. '

    - At the core of an Observation is a flexible key-value pair (or a structured
      collection of key-value pairs), where a 'key' field defines the type of observation
      made, and the 'value' field describes the value or outcome of the observation.
      The fact that the type of observation captured is defined in the data allow
      Observation to convey a broad range of observation data.

          simple value of this attribute stands for an identifier of this data object
          within the system, it can be used as a reference from other objects within
          the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys), and it should be unique
          per type of object. The same data object copied to a different system will
          likely have a different "id" in the new system since "id" values are system
          specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business
          identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured
          in the "identifier" field. The "id" field is more likely to be a serially
          or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is
          created in a system.

    - At the core of an Observation is a flexible key-value pair (or a structured
      collection of key-value pairs), where a 'key' field defines the type of observation
      made, and the 'value' field describes the value or outcome of the observation.
      The fact that the type of observation captured is defined in the data allow
      Observation to convey a broad range of observation data.

    - An Observation Set is comprised of one or more logically related Observations
      made about the same entity. The Observations in a set may be grouped because
      they were generated on a single occasion using a common methodology (e.g. a
      blood panel), and/or or because describe aspects of the same underlying feature
      of an entity and as such are considered together as a logical unit of information
      (e.g. diastolic and systolic measures that comprise a blood pressure observation,
      or T, N, and M components of a Cancer Staging observation).

          the Identifier type has additional attributes to capture this additional
          metadata so the actual identifier values are qualified by the context that
          created those values. This additional context allows "identifier" instances

        - FHIR naming conventions are followed here, where 'id' is used for logical
          identifiers which are unique only within a given system, and 'identifier'
          for business identifiers, which are used to connect entities or share content
          across systems.  The complex 'Identifier' data type is used  to capture
          the identifier itself, along with metadata about its source.

    comments:
    - QuantityMeasure' may be implemented as an Observation-like object that will
      let us capture any type of measure of the amount of some substance (e.g. weight,
      volume, maybe even concentration?), with distinct timestamps and methods associated.  It
      could be implemented as a "simple" observation (one measurement per instance,
      where the 'code' fields is bound to a value set describing the different types
      of quantity measures allowed -  e.g. 'weight', 'volume', 'concentration'),  or
      as "composite" observation (multiple measurements possible in a single instance,
      each captured as a component defined to hold a specific type of quantity measure
      - e.g.  'weight', 'volume', 'concentration').  The number of different quantity
      measures we anticipate needed to support, and the potential for data sparseness,
      are factors that determine whether a simple or composite Observation would be
      most appropriate.

        description: The 'logical' identifier of the entity within the system of record.  The
          simple value of this attribute stands for an identifier of this data object
          within the system, it can be used as a reference from other objects within
          the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys), and it should be unique
          per type of object. The same data object copied to a different system will
          likely have a different "id" in the new system since "id" values are system
          specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business
          identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured
          in the "identifier" field. The "id" field is more likely to be a serially
          or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is
          created in a system.

          created outside the information system through a specific business process,
          the Identifier type has additional attributes to capture this additional
          metadata so the actual identifier values are qualified by the context that
          created those values. This additional context allows "identifier" instances
          to be transmitted as business data across systems while still being able
          to trace them back to the system of origin.

        - At present our model collapses two types of processes through which specimens
          are created (initial collection from source, and derivation from an existing
          specimen).  The 'category' is a flag to indicate which applies to a given

    - At the core of an Observation is a flexible key-value pair (or a structured
      collection of key-value pairs), where a 'key' field defines the type of observation
      made, and the 'value' field describes the value or outcome of the observation.
      The fact that the type of observation captured is defined in the data allow
      Observation to convey a broad range of observation data.

    - This entity is overloaded with the idea of medication/substance based treatments,
      and other more procedure-like interventions that are also considered to be a
      treatment. We should probably separate these concerns and it will be useful
      to have a "Procedure" entity long term. If that is done, this entity will be
      renamed to "MedicationTreatment" or something like that and the other concerns
      refactored out to other entities. Also, if we can consider a medication/substance
      based treatment as a procedure as well (which is commonly the case in other
      models), we can make this entity more about the individual doses for such treatments
      if that level of granularity is needed.
