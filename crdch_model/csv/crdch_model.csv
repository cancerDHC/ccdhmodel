Coding,,"A structured representation of a coded/enumerated data value, that includes additional metadata about the code and code system."
Diagnosis,,A collection of characteristics that describe an abnormal condition of the body as assessed at a point in time. May be used to capture information about neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions.
DimensionalObservation,,"A structured object that describes a single data item about the physical dimensions  of an entity (e.g. length width, area), as generated through a point-in-time observation or measurement."
DimensionalObservationSet,,"A set of one or more discrete observations about the physical dimensions of an object (e.g. length, width, area)."
Document,,"A collection of information intented to be understood together as a whole, and codified in human-readable form."
Entity,,Any resource that has its own identifier
EnvironmentalExposureObservation,,"A structured object that describes a single data item about an individual's exposure to an environmental factor, as generated through a point-in-time observation, measurement, or interpretation."
ExecutionConditionObservation,,"A structured object that describes how long certain parts on an activity took to complete, as determined through a point-in-time observation or measurement.

Information describing the environmental conditions in which an activity, or a specific part of an activity, was performed."
ExecutionTimeObservation,,"A structured object that describes how long certain parts on an activity took to complete, as determined through a point-in-time observation or measurement.

Information describing the environmental conditions in which an activity, or a specific part of an activity, was performed."
Exposure,,"Contact between an agent and a target. A state of contact or close proximity to a medicinal product, chemical, pathogen, radioisotope or other substance."
HistologicalCompositionObservation,,"An observation about characteristics of a specimen at a microscopic level - typically related to its cellular or tissue composition. (e.g. how many cells in the specimen are of a given type, or exhibit a particular cellular phenotype)."
HistologicalCompositionObservationSet,,"A set of one or more discrete observations that quantify the relative or absolute composition of a specimen at cellular level - e.g. how many cells in the specimen are of a given type, or exhibit a particular cellular phenotype."
Identifier,,An Identifier is associated with a unique object or entity within a given system.
Observation,,"A structured object that describes a single data item about an entity, as generated through a point-in-time observation, measurement, or interpretation."
ObservationSet,,"A structured object to hold related data items about an entity, as generated through a point-in-time observation, measurement, or interpretation."
Organization,,"A grouping of people or organizations with a common purpose such as a data coordinating center, an university, or an institute within a university"
Quantity,,"A structured object to represent an amount of something (e.g., weight, mass, length, duration of time) - including a value and unit."
ResearchProject,,"A process where a researcher or organization plans and then executes a series of steps intended to increase the field of healthcare-related knowledge. 
This includes studies of safety, efficacy, comparative effectiveness and other information about medications, devices, therapies and other interventional 
and investigative techniques. A ResearchProject involves the gathering of information about human or animal subjects."
ResearchSubject,,"A research subject is the entity of interest in a research study, typically a human being or an animal, but can also be a device, group of humans or animals, 
or a tissue sample. Human research subjects are usually not traceable to a particular person to protect the subject’s privacy."
Specimen,,"Any material taken as a sample from a biological entity (living or dead), or from a physical object or the environment. Specimens are usually collected as an example of their kind, often for use in some investigation."
SpecimenContainer,,A vessel in which a specimen is held or to which it is attached - for storage or as a substrate for growth (e.g. a cell culture dish) or analysis (e.g. a microscope slide or 96-well plate)
SpecimenCreationActivity,,"The process of creating a specimen. This may occur through observing and/or collecting material from an biological source or natural setting, or through derivation from an existing specimen (e.g. via portioning or aliquoting)."
SpecimenProcessingActivity,,"An activity that modifies the physical structure, composition, or state of a specimen. Unlike SpecimenCreation, SpecimenProcessing activities do not result in the generation of new entities - they take a single specimen as input, and output that same specimen."
