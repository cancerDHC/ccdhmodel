# Data examples demonstrating several proposed approaches for representing coded/enumerated values in the CRDC-H as well as the ObservationSet/Observation patterns
# The source GDC data describes AJCC cancer staging for a patient.  The GDC model defines separate fields for each staging system (e.g. AJCC, FIGO, etc.) and staging system component (e.g. clinical m, pathologic t, etc.)

# Each proposed approache should illustrate how the CRDC-H might represent the harmonized/canonical analyte type concept, as well as where/how the original source values get represented (which may be in the data/message, or in an external mapping file).
